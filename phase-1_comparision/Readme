Phase 1 Experimental Results: Foundational Artery Segmentation

Objective
The primary goal of Phase 1 was to train a robust feature extractor capable of accurately segmenting coronary arteries from a diverse set of medical imaging data.
To identify the optimal architecture, five different models were trained on a composite dataset comprising IMAGE-CAS, ARCADE/syntax, and DCA-1.
The performance of each model was rigorously evaluated on a held-out test set using five key metrics: Dice Score, Intersection over Union (IoU), Sensitivity, Specificity, and overall Accuracy.
Performance ComparisonThe final test results for each of the five candidate architectures are summarized below.
The best performance for each metric is highlighted in bold.

Analysis and Conclusion

The comparative analysis reveals a clear winner from our experiments.
Top Performer: The EfficientNet-Unet (with an EfficientNet-B4 backbone) demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest scores across all five evaluation metrics.
Its leading Dice Score (0.7628) and IoU (0.6192) are particularly noteworthy, as these are the most critical metrics for evaluating the accuracy of segmentation tasks.
This indicates that the architecture's principled approach to compound scaling (balancing network depth, width, and resolution) is highly effective for this specific problem.
Strong Contenders: The SegFormer-Unet (with a MiT-b1 transformer backbone) proved to be the second-best model, showing strong results that were competitive with the winner.
The Inception-Unet also performed admirably, confirming that its multi-scale feature extraction is a valuable strategy.
Baseline Performance: The UNet++ with a ResNet34 encoder, while a solid model, established the performance baseline. 
The results clearly show that the more modern architectures (EfficientNet, SegFormer, Inception) provide a significant performance uplift.

Decision for Phase 2

Based on its dominant performance across all key metrics, the EfficientNet-Unet architecture is unequivocally the best choice to serve as the foundational backbone for Phase 2 of this project.
Its proven ability to generate highly accurate feature representations of coronary arteries will be critical for the more complex multi-task learning challenge of simultaneous stenosis segmentation, detection, and classification.
The next step will be to retrain the EfficientNet-Unet model to produce a final, clean checkpoint file (artery_backbone_efficientnet.pth) that can be reliably loaded for fine-tuning in the next stage.
